              <h2>Get the payout you deserve</h2>
              <p>
                Our mission at Viewpoint is to look at claims from your
                perspective and ensure contractors across the nation get paid
                what they deserve on every job completed.
              </p>
              <p>
                By always leading with clear communication and honesty, we
                strive to simplify the claim handling process so your company
                can spend less time doing insurance paperwork and focus on what
                you do best.
              </p>
              <p>
                As previous restoration business owners ourselves, we
                experienced first hand how proper supplementing of each claim
                positively impacted our bottom line. It was our responsibility
                to be well versed in the supplementing process and most
                importantly, be willing to negotiate in order to reach a 15%-30%
                increase in the overall value of the claim.
              </p>
              <p>
                The supplementing process is often overlooked due to either lack
                of time, education or interest. After understanding how critical
                this step can be to a companyâ€™s bottom line, Francisco and
                Cristobal set forth to form Viewpoint Claims Solutions to help
                roofing companies reach their fullest potential on each claim.
